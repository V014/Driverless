# Driverless
This is a website dipicting automated vehicles, and a few user features like newsletter, FAQ, feedback.
It was also one of my old school projects, it required a server client like XAMPP which I used.
There is a database file that you'll have to import as part of the setup, Or use the setup page once you open the home page to the left in the navigation.
I hope you enjoy using it and notify me about any errors.
There is a countdown timer for a promotion, I hope you'll manage to tune its time because just like every promotion, it expires.

## Landing
The home page of the driveless page is simple and focuses more on the call to actions of the site with two calls to start with.
